        <p>Welcome to our experiment! 8 people, that is you and 7 others will be matched in a group. Group members will remain the same during the experiment. In each round, 3 people get 40 coins and 5 people get 20 coins (but they are not necessary the same people).</p>

        <p><strong>Your endowment:</strong><br />You will receive an Endowment of either 20 coins or 40 coins per round for 5 rounds.

        <p><strong>Your contribution:</strong><br />Each round, you will have to choose how many coins to put directly into your <b>private account</b>, and how many coins to put into a <b>group account</b>.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from <b>private account</b>:</strong><br /> Each coin that you put into your <b>private account</b> goes one-to-one towards your payoff.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from the <b>group account</b>:</strong><br /> Each coin that you and other group members put into the <b>group account</b> will pay you back 0.25 coins.</p>

        <p><strong>Payoff:</strong><br />Your payoff will be equal to: <b>Your Endowment - Your Contribution + Return from the group account</b>.</p>

        <p><strong>Total return:</strong><br />ONE round will be randomly chosen from 5 paying rounds of the experiment. Each round has an equal chance of being chosen, therefore, you should make your decisions carefully in every round. The coins for the round chosen will be converted to money at a rate of 100 coins per USD .</p>
